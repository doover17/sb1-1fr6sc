# Character Sheet App

## Tech Stack

We should use the following tech stack for our Character Sheet App:

1. **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
2. **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
3. **TypeORM**: An ORM that can run in Node.js and supports both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns.
4. **SQLite**: A lightweight, serverless database engine.
5. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

This stack provides a robust, type-safe, and efficient development environment for our application.

## App Features

The Character Sheet App includes the following features:

1. **Character List**: View all created characters with basic information.
2. **Character Creation**: Create new characters with detailed attributes and skills.
3. **Character Editing**: Modify existing character information.
4. **Character Deletion**: Remove characters from the database.
5. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
6. **Data Persistence**: All character data is stored in a SQLite database.
7. **RESTful API**: The backend provides a RESTful API for managing character data.
8. **Server-Side Rendering**: Improved initial load times and SEO capabilities.
9. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the application.
10. **Styled UI**: Tailwind CSS provides a clean and customizable user interface.

Future enhancements could include:
